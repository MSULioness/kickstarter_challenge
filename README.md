# **Kickstarter Challenge**

# Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide Louisa data and visuals on how campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals for her Kickstarter Campaign.

Deliverables are as follows:
 
 1: Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart
 
 2: Outcomes Based on Goals Chart
 
 # Analysis & Challenges
 I used the (docs/Kickstarter_Challenge.md) Kickstarter data set to create two additional tabs: 
 Theater Outcomes by Launch Data 
 and 
 Outcomes Based on Goals 
 for my final results.
 
 **Theater Outcomes by Launch Date Analysis & Challenges** 
 
 This pivot table allows you to filter on Parent  category and Years.  The final data is shown in months and reflects "successful", "failed", "canceled", and "Grand Total" campaigns.  For future campaigns, this analysis will assist in identifying when to launch a successful campaign, based off the historical data. Creating this pivot table was pretty simple, though in the pivot table, I had some trouble with sorting the outcome results in descending order.  
 
**Outcomes Based on Goals**

This analysis details campaigns outcome metrics based on targeted thresholds.  This will allow you to create a stratetgic and targeted campaign with historical data and aniticipated fundraising dollars for United States and International plays.  By providing percentages, you can set anticipated fundraising goals, and measure success overtime.  This analysis provided the most grief :smiling_face_with_tear: as a spent sixty minutes trying to include successful, failed, and canceled plays in one data field, totally overlooking the separate columns for each outcome.  After taking a brief break :partying_face:, I realized my mistake and and proceeded with pulling the data from the needed columns in the Kickstarter tab.  Calculating the sum and percentages were very simple, and I tripled checked my work.  Zero in column D, had me boggled so I verfied, by using the Kickstarter tab, filtering Column R subcategory to plays, filtering outcomes Column F to canceled; though that canceled was not an option. 
 
 # Results
 **Theater Outcomes by Launch Date Conclusions**
 1. May is the most successful month to launch a theater campaign, with June trailing right behind.
 2. December is the worst month to launch a theater campaign.
 
 **Outcomes Based on Goals Conclusions**
 1. Based on the analysis, Louisa's should target her fundraising efforts to plays with a goal of up to $4999; that's the most successful. 
 
 # **Summary of Limitations**
 Both analysis does not clearly show the numerical difference between the outcomes.  For the Outcomes Based on Goals analysis, I would recommend to add a column to display the difference between percentage successful and percentage failed and create an inverse bar graph. 
 
 # **Recommendations**
 A pie chart is better suited to display percentage data; also targeting a specific year range would help with more directional recommendations.
